<p><strong>课程简介 </strong></p>
<p>AP®英语语言和写作课程致力于研究论证和说服，也就是传统上所说的修辞学rhetoric。该课程旨在帮助学生成为有效的读者和作家。目标是理解消息是如何传递的，参数是如何构造的。因为大多数媒体在某种程度上都是修辞性的——也就是说，它有一个读者、观众或听众应该接受的观点——所以认识到我们的世界观是如何被我们读到的、看到的或听到的东西所塑造的，这一点很重要。同样重要的是，作为作家，我们懂得如何最好地表达自己的观点，即使别人不同意，他们也会觉得合理。本课程的目的是让学生探索如何表达合理的观点和有效的交流观点。</p>
<p>AP®语言和作文测试评估学生识别论点是如何提出的、听众是谁以及作者提出这些论点的目的的能力。该测试还期望学生能够认识到作者用以表达论点的修辞技巧，并使其更容易被读者接受。本课程期望学生能够至少在某一特定段落中，识别出用以描述作家作品特征的文体手法。风格分析可能是语言和写作课程中最像传统文学分析的一个方面;这是学生关注文本中的元素，如意象、隐喻和典故。重要的是要记住，风格通常是一个作家的指纹。我们不是看文本所使用的文学手段，来理解它们如何有助于讲述一个故事，而是看它们如何定义一个作家的独特风格，以及一个作家如何使用风格来形成一个论点。该测试还要求学生就某一问题构建自己的论点，为自己的观点辩护。</p>
<p>这门AP®课程有一个必须的暑期作业。学生必须在课程开始前完成他们的暑期作业，并在第一周结束前提交作业。9月1日或之后注册的学生将获得延期，在第三周结束前完成暑期作业。暑期作业的目的是在适用的情况下，复习与课程的先决知识相关的关键内容，并让学生更好地理解与内容相关的严谨性。</p>

<p><strong>课程大纲 </strong></p>
<p>This AP® English Language &amp; Composition course is a virtual course, which meets through threaded discussion, as opposed to “real time” discussions/meetings. Students work independently, collaboratively in small groups, and as a whole class, as well as one on one with the teacher, all through discussion threads devoted to these activities. The course is 33 weeks long, with a Wednesday through Tuesday course week. The syllabus is divided into quarters, with overarching themes for semester one and semester two.</p>
