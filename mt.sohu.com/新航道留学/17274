<p>早些时间，CA系统就公布了2017-2018申请文书题目的变化。 近期，Common Application申请系统又做了一些改革，增加了一些功能，小编筛选出了对大家有用的部分，让我们一起来看看。</p>
<p><strong>变化一</strong></p>
<p>学生可邀请校外升学顾问辅导</p>
<p>学生可邀请校外升学顾问辅导</p>
<p>学生可邀请校外升学顾问辅导</p>
<p>这是今年CA申请系统的一个重大变化，依然是基于CAAS联盟申请系统功能模仿的。之前学生可以邀请在校升学顾问参与申请过程，而2017-2018年开始，通过CA系统递交申请的学生，还可以邀请校外资源，比如校外的申请顾问、独立咨询顾问及社区组织 （community-based organizations） 辅导自己的申请。</p>
<p>CBO, Advising, and Recommender Enhancements: Students receiving support from advising and community-based organizations will be able to work with those counselors just as they work with their school-based counselors and teachers within the application. These individuals will then be able to manage their caseloads and view student progress within the Common App system. In addition, any student who wishes to do so will be able to share a view of their in-progress application with their school counselor, CBO counselor, or other advisor.</p>
<p><strong>变化二</strong></p>
<p>新增Courses &amp; Grades功能</p>

<p>一些大学要求学生在申请过程中自行填写课程和成绩分数。CA新增Courses &amp; Grades功能，意在将成绩递交流程精简、标准化。通过Courses &amp; Grades，申请人自己可以填写高中课程和高中成绩，而填好之后，CA会进行整合，从而方便了学生、顾问和学校这三方。这一功能目前还在测试中，将在2017年8月1日后正式启用。</p>
<p>Courses &amp; Grades: Many students are required to submit self-reported high school academic records when applying to some colleges and universities. With Courses &amp; Grades, students will be able to fill out their self-reported tran information as part of their Common Application. By integrating the Courses &amp; Grades section into the Common App, those students who are already sending this information will be able to complete and submit it with their Common App, making the process of self-reporting trans more standardized and streamlined for students, counselors, and colleges.</p>
<p>Courses &amp; Grades was developed from the feedback of member institutions, high school students, and counselors. The Common Application hosted a series of student and counselor focus groups with beta testing to determine how to make the self-reported tran process accessible and efficient. Courses &amp; Grades will launch in limited release on August 1, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>变化三</strong></p>
<p>和Google云盘整合</p>
<p>这一变化模仿的是CAAS申请系统的Locker功能。和Google云盘整合，学生将能上传文件、简历、作业以及拥有申请的补充资料等。而且，在申请的时候，学生可直接调用存在谷歌云盘上的申请材料。美国很多高中学校都采用Google文档和Google云盘，学生和教师能够在有网络的情况下创建和访问共享文档。这大大方面了美国高中老师和学生之间的协作。功能虽好，但国内还需要翻墙才能使用。</p>
<p>Google Drive Integration: Students will now be able to easily access and upload documents, resumes, and school assignments while completing the Common App and the college-specific sections of the application. We know that many school districts have adopted Google Docs and Google Drive to enable their students and teachers to create, collaborate, and access shared documents from any internet connected device. We also recognize that some students do not always have personal computers at home but use Google Drive on school or library computers to store their documents. We want to meet students where they are. By using the systems that they are already using, we are making the process more accessible for students.</p>
